> This project never went passed the idea stage!
> I think the idea is worth sharing though so here it is.

### Idea

In conference calls, we often base our discussions on a shared document between the participants.
It could be quite convenient to be able to synchronize views between participants
to make sure that they are currently looking at relevant pages.
Ability to point at specific areas such as with laser pointers in real life would be even greater.
That's how this idea of a service enabling upload and interactive broadcast of slides was born.

I also made mockup of what the home page of this service could look like.
