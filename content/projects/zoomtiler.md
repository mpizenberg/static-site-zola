Simple CLI program to generate deepzoom zoomable tiled images.
The input can either be a single image or multiple images of the same height, which are supposed to be consecutive horizontally.

```sh
# Create a zoomable image from
# a list of images making up a horizontal panorama
zoomtiler *.png
```

As of writing this, the main advantage of zoomtiler over another tool like [deepzoom.py][deepzoom-py] or [libvips][libvips] is that it works with multiple consecutive input images.
Meaning, if the huge input image you want to tile into a deepzoom format actually does not exists, but is a horizontal panorama composed many consecutive images, this tool can generate the deepzoom tiles without needing to actually generate the huge panorama first.
Another advantage is that it's a 0-dependency, portable executable that you can just download from the [latest release][release].
