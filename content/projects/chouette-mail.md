For the time being, I only participated in discussions of this project,
lead by my friends Thomas and Matthieu.
I intend to invest more into it when I find time to do so since
I truly think we can find a better solution than the status quo of Web mail clients.
More info on the [GitHub repository of the project][github-repo].
