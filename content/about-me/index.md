Hi! My name is Matthieu and I’m a French Ph.D. student located in Toulouse.
I’ve always been passionate about science and technology!
Quite early, I was spending hours on building Lego and Meccano constructions.
These days I’m more focused on digital content,
but still love getting my hands dirty for some robotics side project.

In my work, I deal with computer vision and multimedia.
I’ve also had a growing interest for functional programming and machine learning.

In addition, I strongly believe in sharing knowlegde and open source communities
so I try my best making all my research content easily available online.
