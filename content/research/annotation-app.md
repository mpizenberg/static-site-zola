### Abstract

We introduce a new application for annotating images, with the
purpose of constituting training datasets for machine learning algorithms.
Our open-source software is meant to be easily used and
deployed, configured to meet the annotation needs of any use case,
and embeddable in crowdsourcing campaigns using the Amazon
Mechanical Turk service.
