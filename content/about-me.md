Hi, my name is **Matthieu** and I’m a **French Ph.D. in Computer Vision** living in Toulouse.
I’ve always been passionate about science and technology!
Quite early, I was spending hours on building Lego and Meccano constructions.
These days I’m more focused on digital content (programming),
but still love getting my hands dirty for some **robotics side project**.

In my work, I deal with **computer vision and multimedia**.
I strongly believe in sharing knowlegde and open source communities
so I try my best making all my research content easily available online.

I’ve also had a growing interest for **functional programming**,
and for the [Elm][elm] programming language in particular.
This is the friendliest language for newcommers I've ever encountered,
so thank you Evan for that!
To give back to the community, I used to co-organize
the Elm Singapore meetups with the amazing [Mads][elm-sg].
Now I'm co-organizing the **Elm Toulouse** meetups with my bro [Matthias][elm-toulouse],
and also co-maintaining the [Exercism Elm][elm-exercism] track.

When I'm not programming, I like spending time with friends
playing board games and eating [raclette][raclette]!
I also enjoy playing football and a new discovery to me, [kin-ball][kinball].
This is a really original sport because there are three teams competing
on the field instead of the classic two.
Give it a try if you are lucky enought to live near a kin-ball club!
